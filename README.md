# Prime-Search (2014)

This was my first attempt at a purely academic and mathematic coding project.
After having a very memorable chat with my high school math teacher, I decided
to go explore with the primes on my own but had no tools with which to do that.
So I built my own. These 4 files given here each serve a certain purpose and
each give a different kind of output.
